Sure! Here's the code for the file `chatbot_integration/dialogflow_api.py`:

```python
import dialogflow

class DialogflowAPI:
    def __init__(self, project_id):
        self.project_id = project_id
        self.session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient()

    def detect_intent(self, session_id, message):
        session = self.session_client.session_path(self.project_id, session_id)
        text_input = dialogflow.TextInput(text=message, language_code="en-US")
        query_input = dialogflow.QueryInput(text=text_input)
        response = self.session_client.detect_intent(request={"session": session, "query_input": query_input})
        return response.query_result.fulfillment_text
```

This code sets up a `DialogflowAPI` class that interacts with the Dialogflow chatbot platform. It initializes the class with a `project_id` and creates a `SessionsClient` for communication with the Dialogflow API.

The `detect_intent` method takes a `session_id` and a `message` as input. It uses the `SessionsClient` to detect the intent of the user's message and returns the fulfillment text from the response.

Please note that you may need to install the `dialogflow` library using pip or another package manager before running this code.
