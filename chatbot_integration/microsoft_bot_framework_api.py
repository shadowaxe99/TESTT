Sure! Here's the code for the file `chatbot_integration/microsoft_bot_framework_api.py`:

```python
from typing import Any, Dict

class MicrosoftBotFrameworkAPI:
    def __init__(self, app_id: str, app_password: str):
        self.app_id = app_id
        self.app_password = app_password

    def send_message(self, conversation_id: str, message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implement the logic to send a message to the Microsoft Bot Framework API
        # using the provided conversation ID and message
        pass

    def receive_message(self, conversation_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implement the logic to receive a message from the Microsoft Bot Framework API
        # using the provided conversation ID
        pass

    def create_conversation(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implement the logic to create a new conversation in the Microsoft Bot Framework API
        pass

    def delete_conversation(self, conversation_id: str) -> None:
        # Implement the logic to delete a conversation in the Microsoft Bot Framework API
        pass
```

This code defines a `MicrosoftBotFrameworkAPI` class that provides methods for sending and receiving messages, creating and deleting conversations in the Microsoft Bot Framework API. You can add the necessary implementation logic inside each method based on the API documentation and requirements of your Ãœber Clone application.

Please note that this code only provides a basic structure and placeholder methods. You will need to fill in the actual implementation details based on the specific functionality and requirements of your application.
