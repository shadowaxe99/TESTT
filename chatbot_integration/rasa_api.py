Sure! Here's the code for the file `chatbot_integration/rasa_api.py`:

```python
from typing import List, Dict
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher

class RasaAPI:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize any required variables or configurations
        pass

    def process_message(self, message: str) -> str:
        # Process the incoming message and generate a response
        response = "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
        return response

    def process_action(self, action: str, tracker: Tracker, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher) -> None:
        # Process the incoming action and perform the necessary actions
        if action == "action_greet":
            dispatcher.utter_message(text="Hello! How can I assist you today?")
        elif action == "action_book_ride":
            # Perform the necessary actions to book a ride
            pass
        elif action == "action_track_ride":
            # Perform the necessary actions to track a ride
            pass
        else:
            dispatcher.utter_message(text="Sorry, I couldn't understand that.")

    def process_intent(self, intent: str, entities: List[Dict[str, str]], dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher) -> None:
        # Process the incoming intent and entities and perform the necessary actions
        if intent == "greet":
            dispatcher.utter_message(text="Hello! How can I assist you today?")
        elif intent == "book_ride":
            # Perform the necessary actions to book a ride
            pass
        elif intent == "track_ride":
            # Perform the necessary actions to track a ride
            pass
        else:
            dispatcher.utter_message(text="Sorry, I couldn't understand that.")

```

This code defines a `RasaAPI` class that handles the integration with the Rasa chatbot platform. It includes methods to process incoming messages, actions, and intents, and generate appropriate responses or perform necessary actions based on the input. You can customize the logic inside the methods to align with the specific requirements of your Ãœber Clone platform.

Please note that this code assumes you have already installed the necessary dependencies for Rasa SDK and have set up the required configurations.
