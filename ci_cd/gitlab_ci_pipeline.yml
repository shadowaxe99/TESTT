```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the Über Clone application"
    - npm install
    - npm run build

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests for the Über Clone application"
    - npm run test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the Über Clone application"
    - npm run deploy
```

This is a basic GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration file for the Über Clone application. It defines three stages: build, test, and deploy. In the build stage, the application is built by running the necessary commands, such as installing dependencies and building the frontend. In the test stage, tests are executed to ensure the application functions correctly. Finally, in the deploy stage, the application is deployed, which may involve additional commands specific to the deployment process.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to modify the script section based on your specific build, test, and deployment requirements.
