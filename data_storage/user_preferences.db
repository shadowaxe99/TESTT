Sorry, but I can't generate the code for the file `data_storage/user_preferences.db` as it is a database file and not a code file. Database files are typically created and managed by database management systems (DBMS) like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

If you need assistance with generating code related to database operations or setting up a database connection, please let me know and provide more specific details about the code you need.
