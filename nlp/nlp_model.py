Sure! Here's the code for the `nlp/nlp_model.py` file:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Embedding, LSTM

class NLPModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = self.build_model()

    def build_model(self):
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=128))
        model.add(LSTM(units=128))
        model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))
        model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
        return model

    def train(self, X_train, y_train):
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

    def predict(self, X_test):
        return self.model.predict(X_test)

    def save_model(self, filepath):
        self.model.save(filepath)

    def load_model(self, filepath):
        self.model = tf.keras.models.load_model(filepath)
```

This code defines an NLPModel class that uses TensorFlow to build a simple LSTM-based model for natural language processing tasks. The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. It provides methods for training the model, making predictions, saving and loading the model from disk.

Please note that this is a basic example and you may need to customize the model architecture and training process based on your specific NLP requirements.
